# About
Yoobe is a 1-click merchandise platform for digital influencers, selling custom artwork, crowdsourced from their fans.

We will help content creators and web celebrities making money with their potential for engagement creating their merchandise store. But not just an ordinary store. Once they sync their social network profile, YoobeÂ´s A.I. analyzes the content and audience and suggests the best products to be sold.

Besides that, we will help content creators getting closer to their audience in a different way, allowing them to invite fans to create cool print art for their products. And every time the product is sold, the influencer and the fan that designed it get paid.
